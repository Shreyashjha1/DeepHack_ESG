Deep Data Hackathon 2.0 - Round 1: ESG & Financial Performance Analysis

This project, developed by Team CodeAxis (Team Leader: Shreyash Jha, Members: Abhishek Raj, Geetesh Mishra, Apurva Kumari), analyzes the relationship between ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) metrics and financial performance using a provided dataset, with exploratory data analysis conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (notebooks/EDA.ipynb), an interactive Streamlit dashboard (streamlit/app.py) for visualizations like ESG by industry and carbon vs. ESG, and a presentation (slides/presentation.pdf) summarizing insights (e.g., tech industry leads in ESG, governance correlates with profitability) and policy recommendations (e.g., carbon-intensity targets).
